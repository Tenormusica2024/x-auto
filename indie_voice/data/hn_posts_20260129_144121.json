    "title": "Show HN: WebPilot – \"Cursor\" for the Browser",
    "text": "Hey HN<p>I just launched the first version of WebPilot – a browser extension that turns your browser into something closer to an AI-powered assistant. Think of it like  Cursor IDE, but for the web.<p>You can give it commands like “click the login button,” “fill this form,” “scroll down and read comments,” or even “grab all the email addresses from this page” – and it’ll do it. It highlights elements, navigates between pages, works on sites like Reddit and HN, and can even take screenshots or copy stuff to your clipboard.<p>I was inspired by the way Cursor integrates AI into coding(use it everyday for all my projects), and wanted to bring that same feel to the browser. Most of us spend hours online doing repetitive stuff, so why not let an AI handle it?<p>What it can do so far:<p>- Click buttons, fill forms, scroll pages – all by command<p>- Extract data and interact with content on Reddit, Hacker News, etc.<p>- Works with voice input (or just type commands)<p>- Has utility tools like page clicks, inputs, screenshots, clipboard copy<p>- Super customizable – hotkeys, model selection(now OpenAI and Anthropic, others is progress), profiles for specific sites with automatic choosing based on opened website<p>- MCP support via SSE transport (for STDIO you could use mcp-proxy of supergateway)<p>Why I’m posting here<p>This is very much a “v1” – it works, but I’m still shaping what it should be with feedback from early users. I’m looking for people who want to try it out and help shape the future of browser automation with AI.<p>There’s a one-time early adopter deal ($199) that gives you all premium features forever + GitHub read access. No subscriptions, no recurring charges.<p>Would love any feedback or feature ideas from the HN crowd – especially what you’d want to use a browser agent like this for.<p>Thanks!",

    "text": "I built this to solve a problem I kept running into: every time I asked Claude Code or Cursor to help with Manim animations, it mixed up APIs between Manim Community Edition and ManimGL (3Blue1Brown’s version), or used deprecated patterns.<p>This repository packages battle tested best practices and working code examples as “skills” that AI agents can automatically load when you are working with Manim.<p>Install:\nnpx skills add adithya-s-k&#x2F;manim_skill<p>What’s inside:\n- Separate skills for Manim Community Edition and ManimGL (they are incompatible frameworks)\n- Working code examples for scenes, animations, 3D, camera control, and LaTeX\n- Common patterns and pitfalls to avoid<p>It uses the open skills.sh standard, so it works across Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI coding tools.<p>Happy to answer questions about the implementation or Manim in general.",
